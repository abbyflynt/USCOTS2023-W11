# USCOTS2023-W11

## Building a website and virtual art exhibit with RMarkdown and Distill

**Abstract**

Did you know that you (and your students) can leverage your RStudio and RMarkdown skills to build a website using the RMarkdown package Distill?  In this session, participants will work through the final project for the Data Visualization & Computing course at Bucknell University.  In this project, students build a Distill website (Allaire et al.) and display a virtual art exhibit where they tell the story of a data set through visualization and narrative.  After learning about the details and objectives for the project, session participants will create their own basic website and learn about the various features available within the Distill package. Participants will then work through a storyboarding activity (e.g Stoudt & Nolan USCOTS 2021) to construct a mini virtual art exhibit with provided code and visualizations to practice customizing and adding content of various types to their website. Before leaving the workshop, participants should have a functional website and a list of objectives and evaluation criteria for a website-based project in their courses.  Participants will need a laptop with RStudio pre-installed and basic coding skills in RStudio and RMarkdown.
